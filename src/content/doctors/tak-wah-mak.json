Key Procedures & Clinical Expertise\n\nWhile the specifics of Dr. Mak's private practice are unknown, his expertise in immunology would likely encompass a range of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures related to the immune system. His clinical expertise is deeply rooted in understanding the intricate workings of the immune system and its dysregulation in various disease states.\n\nHis diagnostic capabilities would likely include:\n\n*   **Immunophenotyping:** Analyzing immune cell populations using flow cytometry to identify abnormalities in cell numbers, types, and functions. This is crucial in diagnosing immunodeficiency disorders, autoimmune diseases, and hematologic malignancies.\n*   **Autoantibody Testing:** Detecting and quantifying autoantibodies, which are antibodies that mistakenly target the body's own tissues. This is essential for diagnosing autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and scleroderma.\n*   **Complement Assays:** Assessing the activity of the complement system, a crucial part of the innate immune response. Deficiencies or overactivation of the complement system can contribute to various diseases.\n*   **Allergy Testing:** Identifying specific allergens that trigger allergic reactions through skin prick tests, intradermal tests, and blood tests (e.g., RAST, ELISA).\n*   **Cytokine Profiling:** Measuring the levels of various cytokines, which are signaling molecules that regulate immune responses. This can provide insights into the nature and severity of immune activation or suppression.\n\nHis therapeutic expertise would likely include:\n\n*   **Immunomodulatory Therapies:** Utilizing medications to modulate the immune system, either by suppressing it in autoimmune diseases or stimulating it in immunodeficiency disorders or cancer. This includes the use of corticosteroids, immunosuppressants (e.g., methotrexate, cyclosporine), and biologics (e.g., TNF inhibitors, IL-17 inhibitors).\n*   **Allergen Immunotherapy:** Administering gradually increasing doses of allergens to desensitize patients and reduce their allergic reactions.\n*   **Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) Therapy:** Providing intravenous infusions of immunoglobulin to patients with antibody deficiencies or autoimmune diseases.\n*   **Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT):** Although he might not perform HSCT himself, his expertise in immunology would be crucial in managing patients undergoing this procedure, particularly in preventing and treating graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).\n*   **Management of Immunodeficiency Disorders:** Diagnosing and managing primary and secondary immunodeficiency disorders, including advising on prophylactic antibiotics, immunoglobulin replacement therapy, and other supportive measures.\n\n### 4.
