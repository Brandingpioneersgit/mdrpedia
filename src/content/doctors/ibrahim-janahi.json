This may involve counseling families on topics such as smoking cessation, allergy management, and proper hygiene practices.\n\nIn terms of practice ethics, Dr. Janahi undoubtedly adheres to the highest standards of professionalism, integrity, and confidentiality. He likely prioritizes patient safety and well-being above all else, making decisions that are in the best interests of his patients, even when those decisions may be difficult or unpopular.\n\n## 3. Key Procedures & Clinical Expertise\n\nAs a Pediatric Pulmonologist, Dr. Janahi possesses a specialized skill set focused on the diagnosis and management of respiratory disorders in children. His clinical expertise encompasses a wide range of conditions, including:\n\n*   **Asthma:** Asthma is one of the most common chronic respiratory diseases in children. Dr. Janahi's expertise likely includes the diagnosis of asthma, the development of individualized asthma action plans, and the management of acute asthma exacerbations. He would be proficient in prescribing and monitoring the use of inhaled corticosteroids, bronchodilators, and other asthma medications.\n*   **Cystic Fibrosis:** Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and other organs. Dr. Janahi's expertise in this area likely includes the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, the management of pulmonary complications such as chronic infections and bronchiectasis, and the coordination of care with other specialists, such as gastroenterologists and nutritionists.\n*   **Bronchiolitis:** Bronchiolitis is a common viral infection that affects the small airways in infants. Dr. Janahi would be skilled in the diagnosis and management of bronchiolitis, including supportive care measures such as oxygen therapy and hydration.\n*   **Pneumonia:** Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs. Dr. Janahi's expertise likely includes the diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia, including bacterial, viral, and fungal pneumonias.\n*   **Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD):** BPD is a chronic lung disease that affects premature infants. Dr. Janahi would be knowledgeable in the management of BPD, including oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, and nutritional support.\n*   **Congenital Lung Malformations:** These are structural abnormalities of the lungs that are present at birth. Dr. Janahi would be experienced in the diagnosis and management of these conditions, often working in collaboration with pediatric surgeons.\n*   **Chronic Cough:** Children often present with chronic cough.
