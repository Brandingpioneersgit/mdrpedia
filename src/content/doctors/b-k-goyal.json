As the <strong>Honorary Dean</strong> and <strong>Chief Cardiologist</strong> at Bombay Hospital, he played a pivotal role in introducing modern cardiac care availability to the Indian public. He served as the Honorary Cardiologist to three Presidents of India and the Governor of Maharashtra. His unparalleled contributions were recognized with all three of India's highest civilian awards: the <strong>Padma Vibhushan</strong>, <strong>Padma Bhushan</strong>, and <strong>Padma Shri</strong>.</p><h3>Early Life and Education</h3><p>Born in Jaipur, Rajasthan, Dr. Goyal pursued his medical education at the historic <strong>Grant Medical College</strong> and Sir J.J. Group of Hospitals in Mumbai. His brilliance was evident early on, as he secured gold medals during his academic tenure. He later refined his skills in interventional cardiology at centers of excellence in the USA and UK.</p><h3>Professional Career</h3><p>Dr. Goyal dedicated his entire professional life to the <strong>Bombay Hospital Institute of Medical Sciences</strong>, where he established the Department of Cardiology and grew it into a world-class center. He pioneered the use of cardiac catheterization and angiography in India at a time when these technologies were nascent globally. He also served as a visiting professor at the Texas Heart Institute and the University of Alabama, bridging the gap between Western technological advancements and Indian clinical needs.</p><h3>Key Contributions & Innovations</h3><ul><li><strong>Interventional Cardiology:</strong> He was among the first in India to advocate for and perform coronary angioplasties, significantly reducing the reliance on open-heart surgeries for select patients.</li><li><strong>Preventive Cardiology:</strong> Long before it became a buzzword, Dr. Goyal championed lifestyle modifications and preventive strategies for rheumatic heart disease, which was rampant in India during his early career.</li><li><strong>Medical Education:</strong> As Dean, he mentored thousands of cardiologists who now lead departments across the globe. He authored the standard textbook <em>Heart Talk</em>, simplifying complex cardiac concepts for both students and the lay public.</li></ul><h3>Awards and Recognition</h3><ul><li><strong>Padma Vibhushan (2005):</strong> India's second-highest civilian award for exceptional and distinguished service.</li><li><strong>Padma Bhushan (1989)</strong> and <strong>Padma Shri (1980)</strong>.</li><li><strong>Dr. B.C. Roy National Award</strong> for Eminent Medical Person.</li><li>Lifetime Achievement Awards from the Cardiological Society of India.</li></ul><h3>Legacy</h3><p>Dr. B. K. Goyal's legacy is etched in the hearts of the millions he treated and the institutions he built. He transformed Bombay Hospital into a beacon of hope for cardiac patients. His passing in 2018 marked the end of an era, but the standards of compassionate, cutting-edge care he established continue to guide the Indian medical fraternity.</p>",

Using angiography, he visualizes the coronary arteries to identify blockages or narrowing.\n\nOnce a blockage is identified, Dr. Goyal would employ various techniques to restore blood flow. This could involve balloon angioplasty, in which a small balloon is inflated at the site of the blockage to widen the artery. More commonly, he would deploy a stent, a small mesh tube that acts as a scaffold to keep the artery open. He likely has extensive experience with both bare-metal stents and drug-eluting stents, carefully selecting the appropriate stent type based on the patient's individual needs and risk factors.\n\nBeyond PCI, Dr. Goyal may also perform other interventional procedures, such as peripheral angioplasty and stenting to treat blockages in the arteries of the legs or arms. He may also be involved in the treatment of structural heart disease, such as valvular heart disease, using techniques like transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or mitral valve repair.\n\nHis clinical expertise extends beyond the technical aspects of interventional procedures. He possesses a deep understanding of cardiovascular pathophysiology, pharmacology, and risk factor management. He is adept at interpreting electrocardiograms (ECGs), echocardiograms, and other diagnostic tests to accurately diagnose and assess the severity of cardiovascular disease.\n\nHe likely has extensive experience in managing patients with acute coronary syndromes, such as heart attacks and unstable angina. He is skilled at rapidly assessing patients, initiating appropriate medical therapy, and performing timely coronary intervention to minimize damage to the heart muscle. He is also adept at managing patients with chronic stable angina, optimizing their medical therapy and considering interventional procedures when appropriate.\n\nHis expertise in preventive cardiology further enhances his clinical abilities.
