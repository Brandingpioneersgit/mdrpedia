Key Procedures & Clinical Expertise\n\nAs a cardiac surgeon, Dr. Bokeria possesses a broad range of technical skills and clinical expertise in the management of various cardiovascular diseases. His proficiency likely extends to the following key procedures:\n\n*   **Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG):** This procedure involves grafting healthy blood vessels to bypass blocked coronary arteries, restoring blood flow to the heart muscle. Dr. Bokeria likely performs both on-pump CABG, utilizing a heart-lung machine to temporarily take over the function of the heart and lungs, and off-pump CABG, performing the surgery on the beating heart. He likely possesses expertise in selecting the optimal grafting vessels (e.g., saphenous vein, internal mammary artery) and employing advanced techniques to minimize complications and optimize long-term patency of the grafts.\n\n*   **Valve Repair and Replacement:** Dr. Bokeria likely performs surgical interventions to repair or replace damaged heart valves, including the aortic, mitral, tricuspid, and pulmonary valves. He likely utilizes both mechanical and bioprosthetic valves, carefully considering the patient's age, lifestyle, and medical history when selecting the appropriate valve type. He likely possesses expertise in minimally invasive valve surgery, utilizing smaller incisions and specialized instruments to reduce trauma and accelerate recovery.\n\n*   **Aortic Aneurysm Repair:** Dr. Bokeria likely performs surgical repair of aortic aneurysms, which are abnormal bulges in the aorta, the body's largest artery. He likely utilizes both open surgical techniques, involving a large incision to access the aorta, and endovascular techniques, utilizing catheters and stents to reinforce the weakened vessel. He likely possesses expertise in managing complex aortic aneurysms, including those involving the aortic arch and thoracoabdominal aorta.\n\n*   **Congenital Heart Defect Correction:** Dr. Bokeria likely performs surgical correction of congenital heart defects, which are abnormalities present at birth. These defects can range from simple atrial septal defects (ASD) to more complex conditions such as tetralogy of Fallot. He likely collaborates with pediatric cardiologists and other specialists to provide comprehensive care for patients with congenital heart disease.\n\nHis clinical expertise likely extends beyond the technical aspects of surgery to encompass the pre-operative evaluation, intra-operative management, and post-operative care of cardiac surgery patients. He likely possesses a deep understanding of cardiac physiology, pathophysiology, and pharmacology, enabling him to effectively manage complex medical conditions and optimize patient outcomes.\n\n### 4. Academic Contributions & Research\n\nDr. Bokeria's contributions to medical science likely extend beyond his clinical practice to include academic endeavors and research activities. While specific publications are unavailable, it is reasonable to assume that he has contributed to the medical literature through peer-reviewed articles, book chapters, and presentations at medical conferences.\n\nHis research focus areas likely align with his clinical expertise, potentially including:\n\n*   **Outcomes of Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting:** He may have conducted research to evaluate the long-term outcomes of CABG, comparing different surgical techniques, grafting strategies, and medical management approaches.\n\n*   **Advances in Valve Repair and Replacement:** He may have investigated the efficacy and safety of new valve technologies, surgical techniques, and perioperative management strategies for patients undergoing valve surgery.\n\n*   **Management of Aortic Aneurysms:** He may have conducted research to optimize the management of aortic aneurysms, comparing different surgical and endovascular approaches, and developing strategies to prevent complications.\n\n*   **Minimally Invasive Cardiac Surgery:** He may have investigated the benefits and limitations of minimally invasive cardiac surgery techniques, exploring their impact on patient outcomes, recovery time, and quality of life.\n\nHis research efforts likely contribute to the advancement of medical knowledge and the improvement of patient care.
