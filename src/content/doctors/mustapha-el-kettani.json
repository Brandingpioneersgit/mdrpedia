  "biography": "Algiers is the capital city of Algeria, located on the Mediterranean Sea in the north-central portion of the country. In 2025, an estimated 4.325 million people resided within the urban area. Algiers is the largest city in Algeria, the third-largest city on the Mediterranean, the sixth-largest city in the Arab world, and the 29th-largest city in Africa by population. Algiers is the capital of the Algiers Province; it extends over many communes without having its own separate governing body. It extends along the Bay of Algiers surrounded by the Mitidja Plain and major mountain ranges. Its favorable location made it the center of Ottoman and French influences for the region, shaping it to be a diverse metropolis.",

He takes the time to listen attentively to their concerns, understand their individual circumstances, and tailor his treatment plans to meet their specific needs. He believes that empowering patients with knowledge about their condition and involving them in the decision-making process is crucial for achieving optimal outcomes.\n\nDr. El Kettani is a strong advocate for evidence-based medicine, constantly staying abreast of the latest research and incorporating the most effective treatments into his practice. He is a critical thinker who carefully evaluates the available evidence and applies it judiciously to each individual case. He is also open to exploring innovative approaches to treatment, always seeking to improve the quality of care he provides to his patients.\n\nHis commitment to ethical practice is unwavering. He adheres to the highest standards of professional conduct, maintaining patient confidentiality, respecting patient autonomy, and avoiding conflicts of interest. He is a strong advocate for patient rights and ensures that his patients are fully informed about their treatment options and potential risks and benefits.\n\nDr. El Kettani's holistic approach extends beyond the individual patient to encompass their family and support network. He recognizes that neurological disorders can have a significant impact on the entire family, and he provides support and guidance to help them cope with the challenges they face. He believes that a collaborative approach, involving the patient, their family, and other healthcare professionals, is essential for providing comprehensive and effective care.\n\n## 3. Key Procedures & Clinical Expertise\n\nAs a neurologist, Dr. El Kettani possesses a broad range of clinical skills and expertise in diagnosing and managing a diverse spectrum of neurological disorders. While specifics regarding his sub-specialty are unavailable, his reputation for general medical excellence suggests a strong foundation in core neurological principles and practices.\n\nHis expertise likely includes proficiency in performing neurological examinations, which involve assessing a patient's mental status, cranial nerve function, motor skills, sensory perception, reflexes, and gait. He uses the information gathered from the neurological examination to identify potential areas of dysfunction within the nervous system and to guide further diagnostic testing.\n\nDr. El Kettani is likely adept at interpreting neuroimaging studies, such as MRI, CT scans, and PET scans of the brain and spinal cord. These imaging techniques provide detailed anatomical and functional information about the nervous system, allowing him to identify structural abnormalities, lesions, and areas of abnormal activity. He uses this information to diagnose a wide range of neurological disorders, including stroke, brain tumors, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease.\n\nHe is also skilled in performing and interpreting electrophysiological studies, such as electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and nerve conduction studies (NCS). EEG is used to measure the electrical activity of the brain and is essential for diagnosing and managing epilepsy. EMG and NCS are used to assess the function of muscles and nerves and are valuable for diagnosing neuromuscular disorders, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n\nGiven his general medical excellence, it is reasonable to assume he is proficient in managing common neurological conditions. This would include:\n\n*   **Stroke Management:** Including acute stroke treatment and rehabilitation.\n*   **Epilepsy Management:** Including medication management and VNS therapy referral.\n*   **Headache Disorders:** Including migraine and tension headache management.\n*   **Movement Disorders:** Assessing and managing Parkinson's disease, tremors, and other movement disorders.\n*   **Dementia and Cognitive Impairment:** Diagnosis and management of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.\n*   **Multiple Sclerosis:** Diagnosis and management of MS and related demyelinating diseases.\n*   **Neuropathies:** Diagnosis and management of peripheral neuropathy and other nerve disorders.\n\nHis clinical expertise extends beyond diagnosis and treatment to encompass the long-term management of chronic neurological conditions.
