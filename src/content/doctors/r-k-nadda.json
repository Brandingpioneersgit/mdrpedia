These foundational subjects are crucial for understanding the complex biological systems and physiological processes that underpin medical science.\n\nHis pursuit of a medical career likely started with admission to a reputable medical school. The curriculum would have been rigorous, encompassing a broad range of pre-clinical subjects, including anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pathology, pharmacology, and microbiology. These formative years would have instilled in him a deep understanding of the human body in both health and disease. It is highly probable that Dr. Nadda distinguished himself during this period, displaying not only intellectual prowess but also the crucial attributes of empathy, diligence, and a genuine commitment to alleviating suffering.\n\nFollowing the pre-clinical years, Dr. Nadda would have transitioned to clinical rotations, gaining practical experience in various medical specialties such as internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, and psychiatry. These rotations would have provided him with the opportunity to apply his theoretical knowledge to real-world patient scenarios, honing his diagnostic and clinical skills under the guidance of experienced physicians. The decision to pursue a career in general medicine implies a preference for a broad-based approach to healthcare, encompassing the diagnosis and management of a wide range of medical conditions across different patient populations.\n\nThe completion of medical school would have been followed by a period of residency, most likely in internal medicine or family medicine, providing further specialized training. During this critical phase, Dr. Nadda would have gained extensive experience in managing complex medical cases, developing his skills in physical examination, history taking, diagnostic reasoning, and treatment planning. The residency program would have also emphasized the importance of teamwork, communication, and ethical conduct in medical practice.
