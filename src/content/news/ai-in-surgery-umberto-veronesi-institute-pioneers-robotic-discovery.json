    "content": "The European Institute of Oncology (IEO), founded by the legendary surgeon Umberto Veronesi, has unveiled a revolutionary AI-guided robotic system that is transforming breast cancer surgery. The ONCO-PRECISION platform achieves tumor removal accuracy within 0.5 millimeters while preserving maximum healthy tissue, dramatically improving both oncological and cosmetic outcomes.\n\nThe system, developed over five years in collaboration with MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, combines real-time MRI guidance, machine learning analysis of tumor margins, and robotic surgical arms capable of movements far more precise than human hands.\n\n\"Professor Veronesi dedicated his life to proving that less aggressive surgery could achieve better outcomes,\" said Dr. Paolo Veronesi, the institute's current director and son of its founder. \"This technology is the ultimate expression of his philosophy—removing exactly what needs to be removed, nothing more.\"\n\nBreast-conserving surgery, which removes tumors while preserving the breast, was pioneered by Umberto Veronesi in the 1970s. He demonstrated through landmark clinical trials that lumpectomy combined with radiation achieved survival rates equal to mastectomy while preserving quality of life. His work transformed breast cancer treatment worldwide.\n\nThe ONCO-PRECISION system advances this legacy through three integrated technologies. First, intraoperative MRI provides continuously updated 3D mapping of tumor boundaries during surgery, accounting for tissue movement and deformation as the procedure progresses. Second, AI analysis compares the live imaging to thousands of previous cases, predicting where cancer cells are likely to extend beyond visible tumor margins. Third, robotic surgical arms execute precise excisions guided by the AI recommendations, with steadiness and accuracy exceeding human capability.\n\nClinical results have been remarkable. In a trial of 340 patients, the ONCO-PRECISION system achieved negative margins—meaning no cancer cells at the cut edge—in 98% of cases on the first attempt, compared to 85% with conventional surgery. Re-excision rates, where patients require second surgeries to remove remaining cancer, dropped from 22% to just 3%.\n\nCosmetic outcomes also improved dramatically. Patient satisfaction scores increased by 40%, with women reporting that their breasts looked more natural after ONCO-PRECISION surgery than after conventional lumpectomy.\n\n\"The precision allows us to sculpt the remaining tissue,\" explained Dr. Viviana Galimberti, the lead surgeon on the trial. \"We're not just removing cancer; we're reshaping what remains. The result looks better because we've thought about aesthetics at every step.\"\n\nThe economic implications are significant. Reduced re-excision rates save healthcare systems millions in repeat surgical costs, hospital stays, and patient time. The system's higher upfront cost is offset by downstream savings within two years of deployment.\n\nThe IEO is now training surgeons from other institutions on the ONCO-PRECISION system, with installations planned at cancer centers in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The technology has received CE marking in Europe and is in FDA review for the US market.\n\n\"My father always said that surgery should be guided by science and measured by outcomes,\" reflected Dr. Paolo Veronesi. \"He would have been thrilled by this technology—not because it's robotic or AI-powered, but because it helps women keep their breasts and their dignity. That's what he cared about.\"\n\nThe institute is already developing next-generation applications of the platform for other cancer surgeries, including prostate, liver, and pancreatic tumors. The fundamental insight—that AI-guided precision can improve both oncological and quality-of-life outcomes—appears broadly applicable.\n\n\"This is the future of surgical oncology,\" concluded Dr. Galimberti. \"Human judgment combined with machine precision. Together, we can do what neither could do alone.\""
