    "content": "Academician Zhong Nanshan, China's most respected respiratory disease expert and the physician who first identified the SARS outbreak in 2003, has launched a landmark research initiative to apply COVID-19 pandemic innovations to the treatment of chronic respiratory diseases affecting hundreds of millions of patients worldwide.\n\nThe Post-Pandemic Respiratory Research Initiative, announced at the Guangzhou Medical University where Zhong serves as president, will conduct clinical trials of next-generation antivirals and immunomodulators for conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and bronchiectasis.\n\n\"The pandemic forced rapid innovation in respiratory medicine,\" said Professor Zhong, 87, who continues to see patients and conduct research daily. \"We developed new antivirals, new delivery systems, new understanding of lung immunity. Now we must apply these advances to the respiratory diseases that kill millions every year without making headlines.\"\n\nCOPD alone affects an estimated 400 million people globally and is the third leading cause of death worldwide. Current treatments provide symptomatic relief but do not alter disease progression. The initiative aims to change this paradigm.\n\nThe research program will evaluate several promising therapies, including modified antivirals originally developed for COVID-19 that show activity against common respiratory pathogens, inhaled mRNA therapeutics that could repair damaged lung tissue, immunomodulators that reduce chronic inflammation without suppressing infection defenses, and stem cell therapies for regenerating damaged airways.\n\nThe initiative brings together 50 research institutions across China, with international collaborations involving partners in the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany. The Chinese government has committed 2 billion yuan ($280 million) in initial funding.\n\n\"Professor Zhong's leadership is invaluable,\" said Dr. Chen Wang, president of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. \"His experience spans from SARS through COVID-19 to now. No one understands better how to translate crisis innovation into lasting benefit.\"\n\nThe first major trial will evaluate a modified version of the COVID antiviral molnupiravir for treatment of acute COPD exacerbations, which are often triggered by viral infections. Preliminary data suggests the drug could reduce exacerbation severity by 40%.\n\nProfessor Zhong emphasized the importance of prevention alongside treatment. The initiative includes a large-scale study of air quality interventions in Chinese cities, examining whether improved air quality can slow COPD progression—with implications for environmental policy as well as medicine.\n\n\"We learned from the pandemic that respiratory health is public health,\" he said. \"Clean air, vaccination, early treatment—these must work together. Medicine alone cannot solve respiratory disease.\"\n\nThe initiative also addresses the challenge of antibiotic resistance in respiratory infections. With bacterial pneumonia becoming increasingly difficult to treat, the program will evaluate phage therapies and novel antimicrobials as alternatives to traditional antibiotics.\n\nPatient enrollment for the first clinical trials begins in October 2024, with initial results expected by 2026. Professor Zhong expressed optimism that meaningful advances could reach patients within five years.\n\n\"Every pandemic leaves a legacy,\" he reflected. \"SARS led to better surveillance. COVID led to mRNA vaccines and new antivirals. The legacy I want is transforming how we treat the chronic respiratory diseases that affect our parents and grandparents. That would justify everything we went through.\""
