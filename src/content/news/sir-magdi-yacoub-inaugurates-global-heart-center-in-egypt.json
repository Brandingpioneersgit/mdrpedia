    "content": "Sir Magdi Yacoub, the world-renowned heart surgeon, has officially inaugurated the expanded Global Heart Center in Aswan, Egypt, creating the largest dedicated cardiac care facility on the African continent. The $150 million expansion will enable the center to treat over 12,000 patients annually, all free of charge.\n\nThe ceremony was attended by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, health ministers from 18 African nations, and delegations from the World Health Organization and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The facility represents the culmination of Sir Magdi's lifelong mission to bring world-class cardiac care to those who cannot afford it.\n\n\"When I started my career, I made a promise to myself that I would use my skills to help those most in need,\" said Sir Magdi, who at 89 still operates several times per week. \"This center is the fulfillment of that promise. Here, a child from a village in Sudan receives the same quality of care as a child in London or New York.\"\n\nThe expanded facility includes 12 state-of-the-art operating theaters, 200 inpatient beds, a dedicated pediatric cardiac intensive care unit, advanced imaging suites including the latest cardiac MRI and CT technology, and a research wing focused on developing affordable cardiac devices.\n\nSince its founding in 2009, the Aswan Heart Centre has performed over 22,000 open-heart surgeries with outcomes that match or exceed those of leading Western institutions. The center's mortality rate for complex pediatric procedures is under 2%, comparable to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London where Sir Magdi spent much of his career.\n\nA key component of the center's mission is training. The fellowship program has graduated over 350 cardiac surgeons who now practice across Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. \"Sustainability requires local expertise,\" explained Dr. Nada Farag, the center's surgical director and a former Yacoub fellow. \"Our goal is that every region eventually has its own skilled surgeons.\"\n\nThe center has pioneered several innovations in low-resource cardiac surgery, including protocols that reduce blood product usage by 60% and surgical techniques that shorten recovery times. These advances have been published in major journals and adopted by institutions worldwide.\n\nLooking ahead, the Magdi Yacoub Heart Foundation announced plans for satellite centers in Kenya, Nigeria, and Bangladesh, each designed to extend the Aswan model of excellence and accessibility.\n\n\"My age doesn't matter,\" Sir Magdi said when asked about his continued surgical practice. \"What matters is that we've created something that will continue long after I'm gone. These walls, these surgeons, this mission—they are my true legacy.\""
