    "content": "Dr. Gagandeep Kang, India's preeminent virologist and vaccine scientist, has been appointed chair of the newly established Global Pandemic Preparedness Advisory Board. The position places her at the forefront of international efforts to prevent future pandemics and ensure equitable health responses worldwide.\n\nThe Advisory Board, created through a resolution at the World Health Assembly, will advise governments and international organizations on pandemic preparedness, focusing on vaccine equity, health system strengthening, and the unique challenges facing low- and middle-income countries.\n\n\"COVID-19 showed us that no one is safe until everyone is safe,\" said Dr. Kang at the announcement ceremony in New Delhi. \"But it also showed us that when it comes to vaccines and treatments, those with the least receive the least. My mandate is to change that for the next pandemic.\"\n\nDr. Kang brings unmatched credentials to the role. She is the first Indian woman elected to the Royal Society of London, a fellow of the Indian National Science Academy, and former executive director of the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute. Her research on rotavirus vaccines helped develop formulations specifically designed for developing country populations.\n\nHer appointment was welcomed across the global health community. \"Gagandeep understands both the science and the systems,\" said Dr. Seth Berkley of Gavi. \"She knows how to develop vaccines that work, and she knows how to get them to the people who need them most. That combination is exactly what we need.\"\n\nThe Advisory Board's first priority will be to develop a framework for equitable vaccine allocation during future pandemics. During COVID-19, wealthy countries secured vaccine supplies far exceeding their populations while many developing countries struggled to vaccinate even healthcare workers.\n\n\"We cannot repeat the moral catastrophe of COVID vaccine distribution,\" Dr. Kang emphasized. \"The next time, allocation must be based on medical need and vulnerability, not purchasing power. Our framework will create binding commitments, not just aspirational goals.\"\n\nThe Board will also focus on strengthening regional manufacturing capacity. During COVID-19, the Serum Institute of India—where Dr. Kang serves as a scientific advisor—produced over 1.5 billion vaccine doses, demonstrating the potential for developing country manufacturers to contribute to global supply.\n\n\"India showed we can manufacture at scale,\" she said. \"But we need similar capacity in Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia. Regional manufacturing means regional resilience.\"\n\nOther priorities include investing in surveillance systems to detect emerging pathogens earlier, developing flexible manufacturing platforms that can pivot quickly to new threats, creating stockpiles of critical supplies positioned in regions rather than concentrated in wealthy countries, and training the next generation of epidemiologists, virologists, and public health leaders.\n\nDr. Kang acknowledged the political challenges ahead. \"Pandemic preparedness requires long-term investment for events that may not happen during any politician's term. Convincing governments to prioritize prevention over response is difficult but essential.\"\n\nShe will serve a three-year term while continuing her research and teaching responsibilities in India. \"I am Indian, but my work must be global,\" she said. \"Viruses don't respect borders, and neither can our response.\"\n\nThe Advisory Board includes 15 members from 12 countries, with representation balanced between developed and developing nations, scientific and public health perspectives, and government and civil society voices."
