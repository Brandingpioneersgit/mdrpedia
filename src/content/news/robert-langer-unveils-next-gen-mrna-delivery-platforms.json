    "content": "MIT biomedical engineering pioneer Robert Langer has unveiled a revolutionary nanoparticle platform that can deliver up to six different vaccines in a single injection, with each vaccine programmed to release at different time intervals. The technology, published in Nature, could transform immunization worldwide by dramatically simplifying vaccination schedules.\n\nThe platform, developed at Langer's laboratory in collaboration with researchers from Boston Children's Hospital and the Gates Foundation, uses \"pulsatile-release\" microparticles that can be engineered to dissolve at precise times after injection—from days to months later.\n\n\"Imagine a world where a child receives one injection at birth and is protected against measles, polio, hepatitis B, rotavirus, and more—with all the boosters automatically released over the following years,\" said Professor Langer. \"That's what this technology enables.\"\n\nThe microparticles are composed of PLGA, a biocompatible polymer already approved for medical use. Different vaccine payloads are encased in particles engineered with varying wall thicknesses and compositions, determining when each payload is released. The precision is remarkable—release timing can be controlled to within 3% of the target date.\n\nIn animal studies, the platform successfully delivered a five-vaccine series in a single injection, with each component releasing at the appropriate time to generate protective immunity equivalent to traditional multi-dose schedules. Human clinical trials are expected to begin in 2025.\n\nThe implications for global health are profound. In developing countries, many children fail to complete vaccination series due to difficulties accessing healthcare facilities for multiple visits. UNICEF estimates that incomplete vaccination contributes to 1.5 million preventable child deaths annually.\n\n\"Compliance is our biggest challenge in global immunization,\" said Dr. Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which funded the research. \"If we can protect a child for life with a single visit, we can reach millions who currently fall through the cracks.\"\n\nThe technology also has applications beyond vaccines. Langer's team is exploring programmable release of chronic disease medications, potentially allowing conditions like diabetes or HIV to be managed with monthly rather than daily dosing.\n\nThe platform's development was accelerated by lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic. The lipid nanoparticles used in mRNA vaccines like those from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna were developed in Langer's laboratory decades ago, and that experience informed the design of the new pulsatile-release system.\n\n\"COVID showed us what's possible when we focus resources on delivery technology,\" Professor Langer said. \"The vaccines themselves are only half the equation. Getting them into people safely and efficiently is equally important.\"\n\nThe research has attracted interest from multiple pharmaceutical companies, and Moderna has announced a licensing agreement to develop combination vaccines using the platform. The first commercial product could be available by 2028.\n\nProfessor Langer, who holds over 1,400 patents and is one of the most cited scientists in history, described the technology as among the most impactful of his career. \"I've spent 50 years working on drug delivery. This platform has the potential to save more lives than anything else I've worked on.\""
