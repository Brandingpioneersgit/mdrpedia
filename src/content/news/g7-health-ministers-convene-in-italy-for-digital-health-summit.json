    "content": "Health ministers from the G7 nations have concluded a landmark summit in Rome focused on establishing shared frameworks for digital health, artificial intelligence in medicine, and cross-border health data exchange. The three-day gathering produced the Rome Declaration on Digital Health, committing the world's leading economies to coordinate their approach to healthcare's technological transformation.\n\nThe summit opened with a keynote address by Dr. Silvio Garattini, the 96-year-old founder of the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research and one of Italy's most respected medical scientists. Dr. Garattini, whose career has spanned the development of modern pharmacology, clinical trial methodology, and health policy advocacy, offered a historical perspective on medicine's digital future.\n\n\"Every technological revolution in medicine has brought both tremendous benefit and unforeseen risk,\" Dr. Garattini told the assembled ministers. \"Antibiotics saved millions but created resistance. Imaging transformed diagnosis but led to overtreatment. Digital technology will be no different. Our job is to maximize benefit while anticipating harm.\"\n\nThe Rome Declaration addresses three priority areas. Health data standards commits G7 nations to adopt common data exchange formats by 2027, enabling patient information to flow seamlessly across borders. This builds on existing standards while adding provisions for privacy protection and security.\n\nAI clinical governance establishes principles for deploying artificial intelligence in healthcare settings. AI systems must be validated through clinical trials before clinical use, must be continuously monitored for safety and bias after deployment, must maintain human oversight in consequential decisions, and must be transparent about their limitations.\n\nCyber resilience acknowledges that healthcare systems are increasingly attractive targets for cyberattacks. The declaration commits nations to sharing threat intelligence, establishing minimum security standards, and developing mutual aid protocols for responding to attacks on health infrastructure.\n\n\"The Colonial Pipeline hack showed what happens when critical infrastructure is vulnerable,\" said US Health Secretary Xavier Becerra. \"Imagine that attack against a hospital system during a pandemic. We must prevent that scenario.\"\n\nNotably, the summit addressed tensions between innovation and regulation. Some ministers argued for permissive frameworks that encourage rapid deployment of beneficial technologies. Others emphasized precaution given the life-and-death stakes of medical decisions.\n\nThe Rome Declaration strikes a middle ground through regulatory sandboxes—controlled environments where innovative technologies can be tested under close supervision before broader deployment. This approach, pioneered in financial technology regulation, allows learning without exposing entire populations to unproven systems.\n\nDr. Garattini, in closing remarks, challenged the ministers to think beyond technology. \"Digital health is not about machines,\" he said. \"It is about people. The question is not what our computers can do, but what we want our healthcare systems to be. Technology is a tool. We must decide how to use it wisely.\"\n\nThe summit also addressed practical coordination challenges. Different regulatory timelines mean that digital health products approved in one G7 nation may face years of additional review elsewhere. The declaration commits to exploring mutual recognition arrangements that could accelerate access while maintaining safety.\n\nHealth data privacy emerged as a significant point of discussion. European nations, governed by the GDPR, have stricter data protection requirements than the United States. The declaration acknowledges these differences while committing to finding interoperable approaches that respect varying privacy cultures.\n\nThe Rome Declaration is non-binding but carries significant political weight. Ministers committed to reporting progress at next year's G7 summit in Canada and to expanding the dialogue to include other nations through G20 and WHO channels.\n\n\"Rome was the beginning of a conversation, not its conclusion,\" said Italian Health Minister Orazio Schillaci. \"But it was an essential beginning. For the first time, the world's leading health systems have agreed on where we're going. Now we must work out how to get there.\""
