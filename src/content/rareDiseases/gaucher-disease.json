    "eli5Summary": "Gaucher disease happens when the body can't properly clean up certain fats inside cells. These fats pile up and make the liver and spleen grow too big, and can make bones weak. Doctors can give special medicines that help the body clean up these fats.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GBA gene encoding glucocerebrosidase. Three clinical types are recognized: Type 1 (non-neuronopathic, most common), Type 2 (acute neuronopathic), and Type 3 (chronic neuronopathic). Pathognomonic Gaucher cells accumulate in the reticuloendothelial system. First-line treatment is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or substrate reduction therapy (SRT). Notably, GBA mutations are the most common genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease.",
    "historicalBackground": "Philippe Gaucher first described the disease in 1882. The enzymatic defect was identified in 1965 by Roscoe Brady at NIH. The development of enzyme replacement therapy by Brady's team in the 1990s revolutionized treatment and served as a model for treating other lysosomal storage disorders.",
