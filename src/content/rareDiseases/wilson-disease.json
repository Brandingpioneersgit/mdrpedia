    "eli5Summary": "Wilson's disease happens when the body can't get rid of copper properly, so copper builds up in the liver and brain. This can make people very sick, but taking medicine every day can remove the extra copper and help people live normal, healthy lives.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by ATP7B gene mutations affecting hepatic copper excretion. Clinical manifestations include hepatic disease (ranging from asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes to fulminant hepatic failure), neurological symptoms (movement disorders, dysarthria, dysphagia), and psychiatric manifestations. Kayser-Fleischer rings are pathognomonic. Treatment with chelating agents (penicillamine, trientine) or zinc must be lifelong. Liver transplantation is curative for hepatic disease.",
    "historicalBackground": "Wilson's disease was first described by Samuel Alexander Kinnier Wilson in 1912. The genetic basis (ATP7B gene) was identified in 1993. The condition became one of the first genetic diseases to have effective medical treatment, with D-penicillamine introduced in 1956 by John Walshe.",
