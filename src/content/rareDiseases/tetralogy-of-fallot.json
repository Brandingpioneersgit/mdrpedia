    "eli5Summary": "Tetralogy of Fallot is when a baby's heart has four problems that make it hard to get enough oxygen to the body, which can make the skin look blue. Doctors can fix these problems with surgery, and most children grow up to live healthy lives.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common cyanotic congenital heart defect, characterized by four anatomical abnormalities: (1) large VSD, (2) pulmonary stenosis (infundibular, valvar, or both), (3) overriding aorta, and (4) RV hypertrophy. Associated with 22q11.2 deletion in ~15% of cases. Primary repair is typically performed in infancy with closure of VSD and relief of RVOT obstruction. Long-term complications include pulmonary regurgitation requiring valve replacement and arrhythmias. Life-long cardiology follow-up is required.",
    "historicalBackground": "Étienne-Louis Arthur Fallot first described this constellation of defects in 1888. Helen Taussig and Alfred Blalock pioneered the first palliative surgical treatment (Blalock-Taussig shunt) in 1944 at Johns Hopkins. Complete intracardiac repair was first performed by Walton Lillehei in 1954. Modern surgical techniques have made TOF highly treatable with excellent long-term outcomes.",
