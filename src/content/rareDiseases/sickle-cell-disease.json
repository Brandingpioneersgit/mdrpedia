    "description": "Sickle cell disease is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders in which red blood cells become hard and sticky and look like a C-shaped farm tool called a sickle. These cells die early, causing a constant shortage of red blood cells and can block blood flow causing severe pain and other complications.",

    "eli5Summary": "Sickle cell disease makes red blood cells change shape from round to curved like a banana. These oddly-shaped cells get stuck in blood vessels and don't carry oxygen well, causing pain and other problems. New gene therapies can now fix the problem at its source.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Sickle cell disease results from homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the HBB gene, causing production of hemoglobin S (HbS). Polymerization of deoxygenated HbS causes erythrocyte sickling, leading to hemolytic anemia and vaso-occlusion. Major complications include acute pain crises, acute chest syndrome, stroke, and progressive organ damage. The 2023 FDA approval of two gene therapies (Casgevy using CRISPR-Cas9 and Lyfgenia using lentiviral gene addition) represents a paradigm shift toward functional cure.",
    "historicalBackground": "Sickle cell disease was the first molecular disease characterized, with Linus Pauling identifying the abnormal hemoglobin in 1949. The specific mutation (Glu6Val) was identified in 1956. The 2023 approval of CRISPR-based Casgevy marked the first CRISPR gene therapy approved in the US, representing a historic milestone in medicine.",
