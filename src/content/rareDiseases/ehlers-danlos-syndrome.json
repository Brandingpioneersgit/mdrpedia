    "eli5Summary": "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome happens when the 'glue' (collagen) that holds our body together doesn't work properly. This makes joints extra bendy and skin extra stretchy. While there's no cure, doctors can help manage symptoms and prevent injuries.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Ehlers-Danlos syndromes comprise 13 subtypes with distinct genetic etiologies and clinical presentations. The hypermobile type (hEDS) is most common but lacks a known genetic marker. Vascular EDS (COL3A1 mutations) carries risk of arterial rupture and organ perforation. Classical EDS involves COL5A1/COL5A2 mutations. Management is multidisciplinary, focusing on joint protection, pain management, and surveillance for complications.",
    "historicalBackground": "EDS is named after Edvard Ehlers and Henri-Alexandre Danlos who independently described the condition in the early 1900s. The classification has evolved significantly, with the current 2017 nosology recognizing 13 subtypes based on clinical features and genetic findings.",
