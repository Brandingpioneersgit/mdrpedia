    "eli5Summary": "Marfan syndrome is like having a body where the 'glue' that holds everything together isn't as strong as it should be. This makes people grow tall with long arms and fingers, and it can affect the heart and eyes. Doctors can help manage it with medicines and sometimes surgery.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene encoding fibrillin-1. Cardinal features include cardiovascular manifestations (aortic root dilatation, mitral valve prolapse), skeletal abnormalities (dolichostenomelia, arachnodactyly, pectus deformities), and ocular findings (ectopia lentis, myopia). Diagnosis is based on the revised Ghent nosology. Management focuses on beta-blocker or ARB therapy for aortic protection and prophylactic aortic root surgery when indicated.",
    "historicalBackground": "The syndrome was first described by French pediatrician Antoine Marfan in 1896 when he noticed unusually long limbs in a 5-year-old girl named Gabrielle. The genetic basis was discovered in 1991 when mutations in the FBN1 gene were identified. The understanding of the condition has evolved significantly, with the role of TGF-β dysregulation being discovered in the 2000s, leading to the use of losartan as a treatment.",
