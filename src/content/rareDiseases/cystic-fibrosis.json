    "eli5Summary": "Cystic fibrosis makes the body produce thick, sticky mucus that clogs the lungs and makes it hard to breathe. It also affects digestion. New medicines called 'modulators' help fix the problem at its source, and people with CF are living much longer and healthier lives than ever before.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which encodes a chloride channel. The most common mutation is F508del. Abnormal chloride transport leads to thick, dehydrated secretions affecting multiple organs. Pulmonary manifestations (bronchiectasis, chronic infection) are the primary cause of morbidity and mortality. CFTR modulator therapy (correctors + potentiators) has transformed outcomes for patients with responsive mutations. Multidisciplinary care at specialized CF centers is essential.",
    "historicalBackground": "CF was first recognized as a distinct clinical entity by Dorothy Andersen in 1938. The sweat test was developed in 1959. The CFTR gene was identified in 1989 by Francis Collins, Lap-Chee Tsui, and John Riordan. The approval of ivacaftor in 2012 marked the beginning of the CFTR modulator era, with Trikafta (2019) representing a breakthrough for approximately 90% of CF patients.",
