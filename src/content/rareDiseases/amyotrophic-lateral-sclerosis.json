    "eli5Summary": "ALS is a disease where the nerve cells that control muscles slowly stop working. This makes it harder and harder to move, speak, and eventually breathe. Scientists are working very hard to find treatments, and new medicines are helping people live longer and better lives.",
    "clinicalSummary": "ALS is characterized by progressive degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness, spasticity, and ultimately respiratory failure. About 10% of cases are familial, with SOD1, C9orf72, FUS, and TARDBP being the most common causative genes. The 2023 approval of tofersen for SOD1-ALS represents the first genetically-targeted therapy. Multidisciplinary care, including respiratory support and nutritional management, significantly improves quality of life and survival.",
    "historicalBackground": "ALS was first described by Jean-Martin Charcot in 1869. The disease gained public attention when baseball legend Lou Gehrig was diagnosed in 1939. The 2014 Ice Bucket Challenge raised over $220 million for ALS research. The identification of the SOD1 gene in 1993 opened the door to understanding genetic causes and developing targeted therapies.",
