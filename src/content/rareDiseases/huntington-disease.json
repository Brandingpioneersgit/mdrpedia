    "eli5Summary": "Huntington's disease happens when a part of a gene repeats too many times. This causes brain cells to slowly stop working, which makes it hard for people to control their movements, remember things, and manage their feelings. Scientists are working hard to find ways to stop the disease.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene (>36 repeats). The pathology involves progressive neuronal loss primarily in the striatum and cerebral cortex. Clinical features include a triad of motor dysfunction (chorea, dystonia, bradykinesia), cognitive decline, and psychiatric symptoms. Diagnosis is confirmed by genetic testing. Management is symptomatic, with VMAT2 inhibitors for chorea. Emerging therapies include antisense oligonucleotides and gene silencing approaches.",
    "historicalBackground": "The disease is named after George Huntington, who described it in 1872 based on observations of affected families on Long Island, NY. The genetic cause (HTT gene) was discovered in 1993 after a decade-long collaborative effort. This was one of the first disease genes mapped using genetic linkage analysis and remains a model for understanding trinucleotide repeat disorders.",
